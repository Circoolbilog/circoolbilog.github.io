"Welcome to our journey through the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. In today's interconnected world, AI is omnipresent, revolutionizing industries and reshaping our daily lives. From personalized recommendations to autonomous vehicles, its impact is undeniable. As we embark on this exploration, we'll delve into the history of AI, distinguish between AI and machine learning, and navigate through the diverse landscapes of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Join us as we unravel the mysteries and possibilities of AI and machine learning."

I figured most of you would notice, but that introduction was written by ChatGPT

If you noticed, Congratulations! You most likely have used ChatGPT or similar tools. --

Since we're talking about AI today I thought it fitting to introduce everyone to this topic. I want to first talk about the use of AI in today's World.

# AI in Today's World:

A few years ago, when the word AI or Artificial Intelligence were to be mentioned, most people would usually think of futuristic concepts portrayed in science fiction movies like the terminator. Others, the more technologically aware would probably think of the early AI assistants like Siri, or other existing technology at the time. Today, A lot of companies use AI mainly as a marketing buzzword. "AI powered search engine," "AI powered appliances," I even saw an ad about a "ChatGPT E-Bike!" There is a lot of confusion today with AI, my hope is that by the end of this, you all will armed with the knowledge to navigate the ever changing world dominated by AI and be inspired to venture to the world of AI Research and Development.

## Machine Vision / Computer Vision

One of the most popular branches of Artificial Intelligence right now, this is also the branch of machine learning where my current work is related. Computer vision helps computers understand digital videos and images. 

Some examples of Computer vision:
- Facial Recognition
- Object Detection/Tracking
- Image Classification
- Optical Character Recognition

If you have an android phone, you can open up google lens, where you can see some of the applications for computer vision. "Translate", "Text", and "Homework" are all examples of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR enables computers to extract text from images to which google can then process the text depending on your needs. The other features of the google lens use different applications of Computer Vision like Object recognition.

## Generative AI

The AI Scene was disrupted with the rise of ChatGPT back in November of 2022

**Artificial Intelligence** - The ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with the intellectual processes characteristics of humans.
**Machine Learning** - Constantly improving a machine through tweaking of parameters based on experience which imitates the way humans learn. 
**Deep Learning** - A sub type of ML that uses Neural Networks. it uses a network of Nodes called "neurons" designed after the human brain.
