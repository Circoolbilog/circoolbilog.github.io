# About Clark Llarena

Welcome to **Circool B-log**

Hey there! I'm Clark Llarena I am the main person who maintains this website. I am a Computer Engineering graduate, and currently working on AI Research. I have a passion for continously learning whatever peaks my interests.

## What You'll Find Here

Whatever I feel like really, it can range from technical tutorials, book reviews, my artwork, things that are going on with my life, and whatever peaks my interests. There might be posts by guests as well.

## Why Circool B-log exists?

I have been stagnant for most of my early adult life, I feel like I'm not moving forward, this website is one of my outlets, something to keep me busy. I have to keep on learning, creating to move forward. This is a way for me to express my self as well as a window to my journey in life.This digital haven is a reflection of my ever-evolving interests and passions, a space where I can bridge the gap between the analytical world of Computer Engineering and the boundless realms of art and literature.


## A Peek Into My World

I used to spend most of my days rotting my brain on Youtube or Short form media, be it reels or shorts, I used to have tiktok as well but I uninstalled it just because of the fact that I am aware of how huge of a time sinkhole it is and yet I just fell into other short form media. After some self reflection, motivational videos, and reading some books, I decided to take some action. and one of those things is creating and maintaining this website.

I am proud to be somewhat decent in programming/coding, but I have very little to show for it, that is why I also plan to keep my github account active with whatever project intersts me. I also used to draw a lot but I've been stagnant in that field as well, same with my interest in music, and playing musical instruments.
